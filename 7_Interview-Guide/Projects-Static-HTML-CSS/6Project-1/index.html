                        Narendra Damodardas Modi is the name of hard-working, achievement, and success. Our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has completed the journey from a "Chay-wala" to the world's largest democracy's Prime Minister. He was born on 17 September 1950 serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is a Member of Parliament from Varanasi.

                    <p>
                        <span><b>Family:-</b> accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben Modi, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams.</span>

                    <p>Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father's tea shop on the Vadnagar railway station platform,[25] a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely corroborate.[26][27] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre.[28] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.</p>
